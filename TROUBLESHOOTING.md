## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Environment Variables

Create a test endpoint to check if variables are loaded:

Create: `/src/app/api/test-email-config/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    host: process.env.EMAIL_HOST ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
    port: process.env.EMAIL_PORT ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
    password: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
    to: process.env.EMAIL_TO ? '‚úì Set' : '‚úó Missing',
  })
}
```

Visit: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/test-email-config`

Should show all ‚úì Set

### Step 2: Test SMTP Connection Locally

Create `.env.local` in your project:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=contact@axanail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=contact@axanail.com
EMAIL_TO=contact@axanail.com
```

Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Test at: http://localhost:3000/contact

Check terminal for detailed error messages.

### Step 3: Test with Port 587

If 465 fails, try 587:

Change in Vercel:
```
EMAIL_PORT = 587
```

Redeploy and test again.
