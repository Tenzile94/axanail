   ```
   Test at http://localhost:3000/contact

2. **Keep Password Secure**
   - Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in .gitignore)
   - Don't share your EMAIL_PASSWORD

3. **Monitor Logs**
   Check Vercel logs regularly to catch any issues early

4. **Email Limits**
   GoDaddy has daily sending limits (check your plan)

## üì± Alternative Configuration

Want to receive at a different email? Change only EMAIL_TO:

```
EMAIL_USER = contact@axanail.com     (stays same)
EMAIL_FROM = contact@axanail.com     (stays same)
EMAIL_TO = your-personal@gmail.com   (changed)
```

This sends FROM your business email TO your personal email.
