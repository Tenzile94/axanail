## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Email service not configured properly"**
→ Environment variables not set in Vercel. Add them and redeploy.

### **"SMTP verification failed"**
→ Wrong SMTP credentials. Double-check host, port, username, password.

### **"Authentication failed"**
→ For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password. Enable 2FA first.

### **Email sends but not received**
→ Check spam folder. Verify EMAIL_TO address is correct.

### **Still not working?**
→ Read EMAIL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting
